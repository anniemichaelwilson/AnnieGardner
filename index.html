        First off thank you so much for taking interesting and checking out my website! This is just a fun little project I wanted to do in my spare time. 
        I have created sections based on different areas of my interests so you don't have to get overwhelmed by all my things!

            Over the last few years my life has evolved into my dream. I met and married the love of my life, I bought a house (my husband had to sell his!), we got
            a beautiful pup. While I have always been big on DIY projects COVID19 has turned me into a full on DIYer (seriously I should have my own TV show LOL). 
            We had our wedding here in our backyard in May 2020, so it started with alot of yard work trying to make it nice.
