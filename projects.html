       I have alot of passion for projects. I think most of it comes from both my Grandmothers being artists (I have no artistic talent but I can create stuff!)
       </p>
       <p>
           Generally my projects begin with some problem I want to solve. Either something isn't as functional as I want it to be or doesn't look the way I want it to 
           look. So I recently started a project notebook. I start with sketching the area that is causing my pain. Then doodling with possible solutions. 
           Depending on the project this usually involves watvhing videos or checking out other blogs where other people have done something similar. Rarely do 
           I find this is the end all be all though. So usually take an idea from here an idea from there and put them together to get exactly what I want. 
           My husband has a love hate relationship with this project book. When I pull it out it usually means money and manual labor are coming, but in the end 
           he USUALLY likes the results!
